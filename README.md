# CSEShell

CSEShell is a simple, custom shell for Unix-based systems, designed to provide an interface for executing system programs. This project includes a basic shell implementation, a set of system programs (`find`, `ld`, `ldr`), and some test files.

## Directory Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- `bin/` - Contains compiled executables for system programs.
  - `find` - Program to find files.
  - `ld` - Program for listing the contents of the current directory.
  - `ldr` - Program for listing the contents of the current directory recursively.
- `cseshell` - The main executable for the CSEShell.
- `files/` - Contains various test files used with the shell and system programs.
  - `combined.txt`, `file1.txt`, `file2.txt`, ... - Test text files.
  - `notes.pdf` - A PDF file for testing.
  - `ss.png` - An image file.
- `makefile` - Makefile for building the CSEShell and system programs.
- `source/` - Source code for the shell and system programs.
  - `shell.c` and `shell.h` - Source and header files for the shell.
  - `system_programs/` - Source code and header for the system programs.

## Building the Project

To build the CSEShell and system programs, run the following command in the root directory:

```bash
make
```

This will compile the source code and place the executable files in the appropriate directories.

## Running CSEShell

After building, you can start the shell by running:

```bash
./cseshell
```

From there, you can execute built-in commands and any of the included system programs (e.g., `find`, `ld`, `ldr`).

## System Programs

- `find.c` - Searches for files in a directory.
- `ld.c` - List the contents of the curent directory.
- `ldr.c` - List the contents of the current directory recursively.

Each program can be executed from the CSEShell once it is running. This starter code only allows the shell to execute a command once before exiting because `execv` replace the entire process' address space. Students need to fix this and allow the shell to prompt for more commands in Programming Assignment 1.

## Files Directory

The `files/` directory contains various text, PDF, and image files for testing the functionality of the CSEShell and its system programs.

## Makefile

The Makefile contains rules for compiling the shell and system programs. You can clean the build by running:

```bash
make clean
```

## Source Directory

Contains all the necessary source code for the shell and system programs. It is divided into the shell implementation (`shell.c`, `shell.h`) and system programs (`system_programs/`).
